Hi, I’m Ravichandran — a Data Science student at DSTI School of Engineering.
I’m passionate about using data to uncover insights and build machine learning and AI solutions.
Experienced in Python, data visualization, statistical analysis, and big data projects.

Currently seeking internship opportunities to apply my skills, collaborate on impactful projects, and grow as a data-driven problem solver.

Let’s connect and build something great together!
